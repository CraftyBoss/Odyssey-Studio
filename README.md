# Sample-Editor
A sample project for making map editors with the map studio engine. 

## Libraries

- GLFrameworkEngine : A 3D engine used for manipulating 3D opengl data with gizmo tools, selection handling, ray casting, and much more. This also includes various helper classes to handle OpenGL easier.  
- Map Studio UI : The UI engine used to display this editor running off imgui. 
- Toolbox.Core : A small, portable backend used for file IO to read/write data along with commonly shared things like texture swizzling and decoding.
